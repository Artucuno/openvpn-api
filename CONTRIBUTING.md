## Branches and versioning
All work is done in master, and `VERSION` in master shows the release we're currently working towards.
Any bugfixes which need to be made should be made in master and cherry picked to release branches for the current release version if appropriate.
Any non-forwards compatible fixes should be made only in the release branch for the given release.
